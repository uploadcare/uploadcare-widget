## 3.1.4 - 2017-09-22

* Fixed the error of the stream from a webcam in Safari 11.

  (instead of triggering resolving).
  In order to resolve use `dialogApi.resolve`.
* `dialogApi.onSwitched` is removed in favor of `dialogApi.progress`
  and tab name.
* `uploadcare.Circle.listen` now expects progress value to be the first
  argument of `progress` callback.
